    <h1>Your city's weather is "Clear/Sunny"</h1>
    <p>The sort of weather where the skies are blue, the grass is bright, and there is lots of sunlight! It is generally warmer when the sun is out, so people in colder climates find it quite pleasant. People located in hotter climates may not be so fond of it.</p>

    <p>The name Quetzalcoatl literally means "feathered snake". The Nahuatl word quetzalli means "long green feather" (Molina: ), but later came to be applied also to the bird who give these feathers: the Resplendent Quetzal. Quetzal feathers were a rare and precious commodity in the Aztec culture. So the combination of quetzalli "precious feather" and coatl "snake" has often been interpreted as signifying a serpent with the feathers of Quetzal. The meaning of his local name in other Mesoamerican languages is similar. The Maya of Yucat√°n knew him as Kukulk'an; the K'iche-Maya of Guatemala, as Guk'umatz, both names can be translated as "feathersnake".</p>
